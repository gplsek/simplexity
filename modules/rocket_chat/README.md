Recommendations
---------------

We strongly recommand you run your Drupal and your Rocket.chat behind a TLS/SSL proxy or webserver.
Currently it will only work when both the website and the webapp are in the same type of connection.
(so the drupal and rocket.chat are both reachable either over HTTP or HTTPS not one with HTTP and the other with HTTPS)

Furthermre we recommand you configure the Livechat to use Agents, and have some agents in the User mangement section of Livechat.

------------

- Install the module in your modules folder, then clear cache
- Submit installation on your website configuration, clear cache
- Switch to [web-site-url]/admin/config/rocket_chat and fill the config form,
  then clear cache (one more time)
- Visit [web-site-url]/[path-chosen] then the widget will appear
